# PlutoSDR Sine Wave Transmit and Receive (Loopback Test)



This MATLAB script demonstrates the **transmission and reception of a 100 kHz complex sine wave** using the **ADALM-PLUTO SDR** in loopback mode. It provides both **time-domain** and **frequency-domain** visualization of the received signal.



---


## Overview



This project transmits a continuous complex sine wave at **100 kHz baseband frequency** using PlutoSDR, receives it back via the same SDR (loopback configuration), and plots the signal in real-time.
