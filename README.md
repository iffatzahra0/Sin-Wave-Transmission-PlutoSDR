\# PlutoSDR Sine Wave Transmit and Receive (Loopback Test)



This MATLAB script demonstrates the \*\*transmission and reception of a 100 kHz complex sine wave\*\* using the \*\*ADALM-PLUTO SDR\*\* in loopback mode. It provides both \*\*time-domain\*\* and \*\*frequency-domain\*\* visualization of the received signal.

\## Overview



This project transmits a continuous complex sine wave at \*\*100 kHz baseband frequency\*\* using PlutoSDR, receives it back via the same SDR (loopback configuration), and plots the signal in real-time.
